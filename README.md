# Eyekiller
Eyekiller tech challenge, based on Cancer Focus NI Figma design.
Live version (albeit on a cheap server) be found here: https://eyekiller.garethgreenaway.co.uk/

I decided against the use of CMS for this as it was a standalone page. I had considered WordPress but that would have been overkill.

Languages/Libraries/npm packages used:
- Vue (as requested)
- Vite
- Tailwind
- Swiper
- AOS (Animate on Scroll)
